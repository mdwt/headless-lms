API keys work on every route under `/api`, not only `/mcp`, sent in the `x-api-key` header or as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. A request that carries a key is judged on the key alone and never falls back to a session cookie. A key carries one of the organization's roles and holds that role's current permissions, limited to its creator's; it can expire after 1 to 365 days, and every new key starts with `hlms_`. `GET /api/access/api-keys/roles` lists the roles a person can put on a key, and a role can't be deleted while a key carries it.

A platform key, set with `PLATFORM_KEY` and `PLATFORM_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`, creates organizations and their API keys through `POST /api/platform/organizations` and `POST /api/platform/organizations/:orgId/api-keys`. The organizations are owned by a platform account that can't sign in.

Breaking changes:

- `POST /api/access/api-keys` takes `role` and an optional `expiresInDays` instead of `scopes`. A key's response carries `role` and `expiresAt` instead of `scopes`. Keys created with scopes no longer verify.
- `OrganizationService.resolveCaller` and `actorFor` take a `CallerLimit` (`{ scopes }` or `{ roleKey }`) instead of a scope list, and `AccessGrant` carries `limit` instead of `scopes`.
- The `ApiKeys` port returns stored keys with `roleKey` and `expiresAt`, takes `{ name, roleKey, expiresInDays }` on create, and adds `countWithRole`. `OrgAdmin` adds `createOrganizationFor`, and the new `Accounts` port creates the platform account.
