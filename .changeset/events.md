Events: a content type with a time, a time zone, a location (a venue with its address, a meeting link, or both), a recording, attached files and settings (`public` or `private`, a capacity, notifications on or off, and replay). Staff create, edit, publish, cancel and delete events through `/api/events` and the MCP event tools; members list, open and register through `/api/member/events`, and get a calendar file per event. Going to an event is a grant: registering, staff adding someone, an API client and the automations Grant access action all call `entitlements.grant`, which holds every event rule, takes a capacity lock and counts the attendees under it. Attendees are notified when they are added or removed, when the event moves or changes place, when it is canceled, and a day and an hour before it starts. The admin overview counts upcoming events, and each event has attendee and analytics reads.

`entitlements.revoke` takes a person and a content id. `entitlements.ensureGrant` is removed: automations grant through `grant`, so granting again makes a revoked or expired grant active with the new expiry. The service sets a grant's `source` from the caller (`self`, `automation` or `manual`); `GrantEntitlementInput` no longer takes one.

Domain events carry `metadata.actorId`, renamed from `actorOrgUserId`, and so do the request context and notifications (`actorId`, column `actor_id`).

`ContainerConfig.databasePool` sizes the API's Postgres pool: `max`, `idleTimeoutMillis` and `connectionTimeoutMillis` (`DATABASE_POOL_MAX`, `DATABASE_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` and `DATABASE_POOL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` in the API). Unset values keep pg's defaults.

Breaking: `actorOrgUserId` is `actorId` in domain event metadata and notifications; `EntitlementsService.ensureGrant` and `EntitlementsRepository.insertIfAbsent` and `setExpiresAt` are removed; the entitlements `SpaceReader` port is `ContentReader`.
